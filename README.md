# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview 

Purpose of this project was to perform analysis on the ride -sharing data by the city type. The CEO wanted to get deeper understanding on the ride-sharing data across cities in terms of total number of rides, total number of drivers, and total fare for each city type. Based on this average fare per ride and average fare per driver for city type was to be provided. Graphical illustration of the total weekly fares based on city types is also expected to understand any trends. This information will be utilized to determine which type of neighborhoods need to be funded or need improved access for ride-sharing services. 

## Results

The findings reflect ride-sharing trends which make logical sense. Further one gets from urban cities, the less accessible ride-sharing services are and also drivers have more monopoly in smaller cities. Rural cities had the least number of rides (125) as compared to Suburban (625) and Urban (1625). The costs of ride-sharing rises as the distance from the urban cities increases. Total drivers that service the city types is however starkly spread out. While there are 78 drivers servicing the rural cities, in suburban areas there are 490 drivers and in urban cities the density of drivers is much higher at 2405. 

### Summary of Results:

The trends of weekly fares based on city type as shown below clearly indicates that the total fares by city type is much higher for urban areas and the total fares in rural areas are the lowest. The cyclical variation in the monthly fares through out the year will be worth looking at to further understand trends. 

### Graphical Illustration: 

Summary: Based on the results, the urban cities which have higher total fares, but lowest average fare per driver appears to be an area to offer incentives for drivers in this city type. Urban cities are often expensive to live and incentives such as making a cross region journey to and from uban cities to surrounded suburban and rural settings would incentivize drivers. The average fares per driver in these areas are less than half of the suburban areas. Drivers allocation based on zipcode and cross coverage across urband and suburban areas will boost the income from fares for drivers in the urban areas. 

Suburban areas which are often surrounding major urban areas are predictably also in the in-between range for the average fare per driver and average fare per ride compared to the urban and rural cities. Total number of drivers in the suburban areas are almost one third of the urban areas. The average fare per driver in this region is desirable compared to urban area drivers and these regions may need added ride sharing infrastructure to evenly spread out accessibility to the ride-sharing services across the urban and suburban areas. With more drivers available to avail the ride sharing services, the gaps in fare and driver average returns per ride are likely to get more evenly spread out. 

Rural areas are often challenging to implement any major strategic changes. Accessibility to services is often lower in these areas and hence there is room to monopolize and gain larger share of the rides per driver in these regions. Existing drivers are already at an advantage in terms of average fare based on the subset of the data that was provided. Looking at other factors such as any seasonal variations, whether drivers in rural versus urban areas are dependant on the ride-sharing services as their only source of income will be interesting. Without understanding additional trends for the rural cities, it is advisable to keep up with existing funding for these areas with main focus on providing digital connectivity across drivers. 

Overall in order to address the disparities in the drivers availability, fare per ride and the drivers fares across the city types few things to consider are;
  - Building incentives and bonuses to drivers in urban area
  - Offering better infrastructure and connectivity for ride-sharing services across regions
  - Look at the cluster regions to offer ride sharing services and offer cluster routes across a city with a surrounding suburban town or a suburban & rural town 

Further understanding income sources for drivers across city types and providing better services such as longer routes for ride sharing, will also be beneficial and of interest to drivers who provide services in the vicinity.
